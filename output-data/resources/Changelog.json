In terms of specific matchmaking changes, in cases where the party has a large gap in skill, the party\u2019s overall skill will now be biased closer to the best player\u2019s values rather than the average.

An example of this is someone dealing 800 spirit damage to you and you having 80 Spirit Shield and 45% Spirit Resistance. With the bug, the 800 would be reduced to 720 from the shield, and then you would lose 720 health. With the fix, the shield now reduces the damage to 720 as usual, but the remaining amount then gets reduced by 45% to 396 health lost instead of 720.\u200b",
