        "- Reworked the invite system in the client to streamline the process. Emails are no longer required, the users will now receive access directly through Steam and {{ItemIcon|Item=Discord|Size=20}} Discord/Forum access will be available through the client. The UI will now also group users into three categories: available to invite, already invited, and already have access. This new system will result in less invitations stuck in limbo, and any previous invites that have not already claimed the game will be granted through this system as well."
