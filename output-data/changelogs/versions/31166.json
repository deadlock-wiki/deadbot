Pre 10 min, lanes now always split {{PageRef|Orb|alt_name={{PageRef|Orb|alt_name=orb}}s}} when there are more heroes than the assigned participants for that lane (3+ people in a dual lane, 2+ people in a solo). Previously it only split with 3+ people regardless of the lane, which is what allowed soul abuses when dipping into a solo lane.",
