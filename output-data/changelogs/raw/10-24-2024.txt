[ General Changes ]

- Added 6 new heroes to Hero Labs, a new experimental hero matchmaking mode. The heroes are Holliday, Calico, Wrecker, Fathom, Viper and Magician (temp names). The goal of this mode is to invite players to help us in giving hero design feedback while heroes are in very early phases. Most heroes in this mode will have placeholder models, names, effects, etc (some exceptions are older in-dev heroes that had more developed art). They will also sometimes have placeholder/copy-paste abilities for certain slots if that ability slot is still TBD (such as Magician ultimate). There will be a specific hero labs section on the forum to post feedback on these. Heroes in this mode will often be removed, abilities changed, new heroes added, removed heroes re-added, etc. Patch notes for changes to heroes in this mode will be posted on the Hero Labs subforum. This mode will have limited testing hours for now while we gauge activity, in order to ensure faster queue times. You must have at least 50 games played to be able to queue here. If you don't get a new hero selected (since there are less new heroes than there are players), you will be considered higher priority for subsequent matches to get a new hero from your roster selection.

- Added Commends. You can commend players you've enjoyed playing with during the game or in the post-game scoreboard (same places you would report).  The number of commends you've received on each hero will be displayed in your profile.

The minimap will show where the drop-off location is as usual, as well as an indicator in the world that helps show you where it is.
