[ Ranked Mode ]

- Added Ranked mode

We are experimenting with a different approach to Ranked during early development, we expect to iterate on it in the future. The focus of this mode will be on concentrating players into specific time windows where they can opt into games where the primary focus is on game quality.

You must have 50 games played in order to enter this mode. If you have any behavior related restrictions (voice/text bans, report misuse, etc), you will be unable to queue into this mode.

The queue will be solo only at the moment and will be open from 1pm-4pm and 7pm-10pm in the respective time zones every day. Each region will have multiple time zones you can select from to find what best fits your schedule (you can only change your selection once per week). Players will be automatically assigned the server in that region that provides the best ping for the players in the match.

When in this mode, you will only be matched with players that have the same medal as you. There are 11 medals in total with 6 levels in each. Everyone's medal and levels will be displayed in these ranked games.

Every Tuesday at 8PM GMT we will run an algorithm that calculates everyone's performance together at the same time based on the games you've played, how the opponents you played against ended up faring in subsequent games, etc. As such, medals will only be updated once per week, to allow for analysis of a wide set of match data together at once for a more accurate review of your skill (rather than a fixed numerical addition/subtraction on a per game basis).

In order to make sure there are enough data to cross reference with other players, you must play at least 7 games in order to be eligible to receive a rank for that week. If at any time you didn't have 7 games played in the previous week, your medal will be marked as undefined until you play enough and earn a new medal the following Tuesday.

The ranked queue will first open next Tuesday, October 15th at 8PM GMT. The first medals will be granted globally the following Tuesday, October 22nd 8PM GMT. You'll have a panel that shows you the history of your previous medals.



[ General Changes ]
