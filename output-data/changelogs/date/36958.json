            "You must have 50 games played in order to enter this mode. If you have any behavior related restrictions (voice/text bans, report misuse, etc), you will be unable to queue into this mode.",
            "The queue will be solo only at the moment and will be open from 1pm-4pm and 7pm-10pm in the respective time zones every day. Each region will have multiple time zones you can select from to find what best fits your schedule (you can only change your selection once per week). Players will be automatically assigned the server in that region that provides the best ping for the players in the match.",

If at any time you didn't have 7 games played in the previous week, your medal will be marked as undefined until you play enough and earn a new medal the following Tuesday.",
            "The ranked queue will first open next Tuesday, October 15th at 8PM GMT. The first medals will be granted globally the following Tuesday, October 22nd 8PM GMT. You'll have a panel that shows you the history of your previous medals."
