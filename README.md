DeadBot is an Open Source automation tool for aggregating data from the raw game files with the purpose of accurately maintaining the Deadlock Wiki - https://deadlocked.wiki/

## Guide
All data can be found in the `output-data` directory, which includes json and csv formats

### Google Sheets
Some data has been processed and formatted for google sheets:\

## Installation

### Setup
1. Install Python 3.11+
2. **[OPTIONAL]** Add Python scripts dir to your environment. This lets you omit `python -m` when calling third-party modules
    1. Get <python_path> with `python -m site --user-base`
    2. Add to ~/.bash_profile - `export PATH="$PATH:<python_path>/Python311/Scripts"`

3. `pip install poetry`
4. `python -m poetry install`
5. `python -m pre_commit install`
6. Download Decompiler.exe for your particular OS from https://github.com/ValveResourceFormat/ValveResourceFormat/releases 
7. Extract decompiler into `Downloads/` folder
8. Add the paths to Deadlock files and the Decompiler in `.env` using `.env.example` as an example

### Usage
`bash main.sh` to run end-to-end decompilation, parsing and bot (bot is a WIP)\
`bash parser.sh` to just run the parser. Must have already run `main.sh` once to decompile the source files


## Contributing
DeadBot is currently early in its development and welcomes new contributers to get involved no matter what level experience you have.

Regularly discussed in the wiki channel on [the Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/jUyhZKwxSW). Ask for access on there if you are interested in contributing.

At the moment the work is fairly ad-hoc, so find me on discord as "HariyoSaag" if you're not sure where to start.
