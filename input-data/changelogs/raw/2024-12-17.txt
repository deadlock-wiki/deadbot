Season's Greetings! Today's themed visual update will be our last patch for the year, but we'll continue to ship bug fixes and any urgent balance adjustments as needed throughout the break. Thanks to everyone for all the useful feedback that you've given us this year, we're looking forward to sharing more of what's to come for Deadlock in 2025. For now, we hope that everyone has a magical season full of joy, souls, and surprises...
