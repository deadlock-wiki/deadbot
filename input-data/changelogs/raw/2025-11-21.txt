[ General ]

- Trooper bounty mechanics have been reworked. The first half of the souls still fly out as deniable orb, however rather than the other half being instantly given to nearby players it will fall to the ground as an orb that you need to get near to pick up. It has a 18m capture radius where it'll travel to you once you get within. Only one player needs to claim it, share rules remain the same as before.
